    <h2>HTML Entities</h2>
    <p>
      There are three reserved characters in HTML: &lt; &gt;, and &amp;. You
      should always use HTML entities for these characters. Entities start with
      an ampersand (&amp;) and end with a semicolon (;)
    </p>
    <p>Curly quotes also "need" to use HTML entities!</p>
