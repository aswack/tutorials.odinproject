    <h1>Links</h1>
    <p>
      This page covers the types of links, but you may also be looking for
      <a href="./images.html">images</a> or useful
      <a href="misc/extras.html">extras</a>!
    </p>
    <p>There are three links of links:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Absolute links: like to
        <a
          href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/web/HTML"
          target="_blank"
          >Mozilla Developer Netork</a
        >, which is an excellent resource for web developers.
      </li>
      <li>
        Relative links: like to our own
        <a href="./misc/extras.html">extras</a> page, which resides on a
        different folder in the server.
      </li>
      <!-- This doesn't quite work right now, on my machine, it the / takes me to the root of the hard drive all of my files are stored in!-->
      <li>
        Root-relative links: like to the <a href="/">home page</a> of our
        website, but those aren't useful to us right this moment (but will be in
        the future!)
      </li>
    </ul>
